## Stuffing

### Steps

#### Broth

  - 4 celery
  - 2 onions
  - 4 carrots
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 1 chicken carcass
- fill with as much water as you can safely use
- cook on low simmer for like 4-5 hours (considerably less in pressure cooker)

Let cool and set aside. Can be done at a previous time.

#### Croutons

Making croutons from scratch is one of the keys to this recipe. It makes a huge
difference in the final taste.

- preheat the oven to 300F
- cut enough bread into small cubes fill a large bowl about half way
- drizzle the croutons with olive oil to taste
- season the croutons with pepper, thyme, sage, parsley, garlic powder to taste
- bake
- every 10 minutes take a spatual and toss the croutons to cook evenly
- when the croutons are starting to brown and are crunchy throughout, remove to cool (~45 mins)

#### Sausage

Get a package (4-5) of the best sweet italian sausages you find.

- remove them from their casings
- brown in pan over medium-ish heat

Set aside.

#### Aromatics

- dice 1 onion
- dice 3 carrots
- 1 tsp of dry sage
- dice 3 celery stalks
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tsp of dry thyme or a few sprigs of fresh

Put a splash of olive oil in a pan and heat over medium heat.
When the oil is warm add the ingredients and stir.
Soften vegatables until the carrots are little soft and the onions
are translucent. About 10 minutes.

Set aside.

### finally the stuffing

- add croutons back to the large mixing bowl
- fold in sausage
- fold in aromatics
- add 1 cup of broth and fold entire contents until you aren't seeing broth at the bottom of the bowl
- repeat the previous step until the croutons just start to break apart a little bit
